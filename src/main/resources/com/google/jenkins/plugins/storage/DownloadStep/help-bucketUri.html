    This specifies the cloud object to download from Cloud Storage.
    You can view these by visiting the "Cloud Storage" section of the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console">Cloud Console</a> for your project.<br>
    A single asterisk can be specified in the object path (not the bucket name), past the last "/". The asterisk behaves constently with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WildcardNames">gsutil</a>. For example, <code>gs://my-bucket-name/pre/a_*.txt</code> would match the objects in cloud bucket <code>my-bucket-name</code> that are named <code>pre/a_2.txt</code> or <code>pre/a_abc23-4.txt</code>, but not <code>pre/a_2/log.txt</code>.
